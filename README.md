All the talks
=============

This repo will host links to all the public speaking materials I give. This
list will be updated as new talks are done, so check back often!

The format of the talks I give varies. I typically like to make very wordy
slides, so that they can serve as holistic reference material later. You will,
however, see presentations that are much more lightweight, with commentary
provided in the speaker notes section. Most talks also include links to the
relevant GitHub repo, if code samples were provided.

Public talks will have presentation citations below; internally-given talks
will not.
